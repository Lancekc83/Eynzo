Installing EMU is highly recommended 

https://github.com/emu-sh/.oh-my-comma
 
with EMU installed (reboot needed)


Open Android settings      


[emu device settings]




Close Android settings    


[emu device settings -c ]



NOTE: Need this 3 settings for that planted drive.


Laneless OFF

Learner OFF

LQR OFF



Since mounting (eyeball install) is different you have to play with the camera offset toggle.
If you think your drive is off.
Please remember to wait for a few more seconds after calibration hit 100% seems the progess bar 
is kinda off, before starting your observation

This is performance fork due to high steer ratio, 'holding the wheels" during fast curves as you 
press the pedal is highly recommended. 







# In order for this fork to work properly, you must have Allow Gas enabled within the settings.

Dragonpilot with Spektor56's 24/7 LKAS for Hondas. This is a clean merge without any extra modifications. Check out my other branch for that.
